Implement real weather integration using Open-Meteo.

Modify the weather_service so that:

1. For each fixture get stadium coordinates from stadium_repository
2. Call the Open-Meteo forecast API
3. Find the forecast closest to kickoff_datetime
4. Return normalized weather data

Use requests library.

Handle:
- API timeouts
- missing data
- external API errors

Do not change the response format expected by /api/fixtures/weather.
